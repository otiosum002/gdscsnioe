Tools used - HTML, CSS. JS

As for my approach, I thought the page given looked too bland so I added some boxes to make it look better. Flexbox just wasn't doing what I had in mind so I had to go with grid instead. 
Even though it isn't much, I thought the added touch to heading when you hover over it with you mouse kinda looked cool even though non functional and that just so happens to be what gave me the most amount of problems. It took me a while to implement the logic behind the code.
